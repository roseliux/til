# Increasing or decreasing_numbers

In normal mode, typing Ctrl-A will increment the next number, and typing Ctrl-X will decrement the next number. The number can be at the cursor, or to the right of the cursor (on the same line).

These keys work with a count. For example, pressing 5 then Ctrl-A will increment the following number five times (add 5).
